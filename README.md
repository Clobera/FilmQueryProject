# Film Query Project

## Overview
The Film Query Project is a Java program that interacts with a database to display movie information to the user. The user is presented with a menu of options, which includes searching for a movie by ID number or keyword. The program then displays relevant information about the movie, such as its release date, rating, language, and cast list.

## How to Use
To use the program, the user runs the Java file in a command prompt or IDE and follows the prompts to search for a movie. If the user selects the option to search by ID number, they will be prompted to enter an ID number to view information about a specific movie. If the user selects the option to search by keyword, they can enter a keyword that is searched within the movie's title or description. The program then displays the search results, which include the movie name, release date, description, rating, language, and list of cast.

## Technologies Used
The program was developed using the following Java features:

- Constructors
- Getters and Setters
- Do While loops
- While loops
- Try Catch blocks
- Exceptions
- Methods with arguments
- ArrayLists
- Created Abstract Objects

In addition, the following tools were used to develop and manage the project:

- Java
- MySQL Database
- Maven Dependencies
- Git for version control
- GitHub for project hosting and collaboration


## Learning Outcomes
During the development of this project, I gained experience with:

- Object-oriented programming concepts in Java
- Using Git and GitHub for version control and collaboration
- Working with databases and SQL queries
- Implementing control structures such as loops and Try Catch blocks
- Creating and using methods with arguments and abstract objects
- Writing readable and maintainable code
