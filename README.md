# Film Query Project


### Description
For this weeks project we were tasked with creating a program to list different options to a user, and getting information from a data base based on the options they chose. First the user is prompted with a menu to to choose from. if the user picks option one they will be prompted to enter an id number and will be shown the movie based on the id number entered. Next, if the user enters option two from the menu they will be prompted to enter a key word. The program will search through the data base and see if either the title or description includes the keyword. When the movie results are shown the program lists:
<li> Movie Name
<li> The date released in parenthesis
<li> Description of the Movie
<li> Movie rating
<li> Language
<li> List of Cast

<li> Methods with arguments
<li> ArrayLists
<li> Created Abstract Objects
<li> MySQL Database
<li> Maven Dependencies



### What I learned
<li> In this project I really focused on making my code readable. I added methods in the Film Query app to make the launch method clearer and to minimize the amount of nested loops with each other. I keep getting told the code is read more often than written so that was a main focus along with getting the code to work.
<li> In my code i wanted to make it to where if they enter the wrong data type or wrong menu option to end the current loop and start over. The Try and Catch blocks was something I have been struggling to grasp but I realized I would need to implement them when having user enter the input for what they would want to search. After googling and reading on Stack Overflow, I finally figured out how to implement it and got my code to work.
<li> MySql was also a struggle of its own. I would find myself getting stuck on trying to list the data I wanted before even writing the code to link it to this java application. I decided to do what my instructor Dee was doing in class while teaching the lecture. I decided to write the query on a text file before entering it onto mysql so i can verify the spelling and grammar were correct.
